Project 1


### Working on manipulating data to change dates to seasons 
- struggling with a good proper way to sort data in a relevant way for the project
- Only dates available in the csv for airbnb are 'last reviewed' which only gives us a date of usage for that bnb for that given review not a large amount of stays across the span of a year
