FUN History:  The house was nicknamed  ""Ansel's Getaway"" as ANSEL ADAMS was friends with the original owner of the home, John Bei.  Ansel and John would hang out in the basement smoking cigars and discussing leather tanning projects.  At the time, Ansel and John worked together at a local leather tannery shop creating camera cases of course!  According to the Bei grandchildren, Ansel was quite a character and a frequent visitor of the home.

Also, at night it is a great beach for bonfires.  We hope you enjoy the house!

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

Hello to anyone reviewing my home. I hope we will meet you soon. COVID has changed everything. I have only just now re-opened. Welcome back. Prior to the shutdown, we hosted happy travelers from 23 countries, were super hosts and had many positive reviews. 

For those of you traveling into Santa Cruz County.... our home is centrally located and close to highway one and the beach. Occasionally, there may be some freeway noise. 

My rooms are on the second floor, up stairs. My doorway requires a step up of four inches. Therefore I have to say my home is not very accessible at all. We HAVE accommodated a gentleman who just had knee surgery, and two guests with canes, who took good advantage of my staircase bannisters. 

My home is in a neighborhood with streetlights and sidewalks, and I have a very long driveway so you can park off the street.
Spring is upon us, and the days are crisp and sunny, reaching 80’s and low nineties. My home has no air conditioning, but it’s almost always a comfortable temp. The nights are in the 40's and 50's.

The beaches are very occupied, and the tourists and events are back thankfully, so our community has returned to its full and busy feel. 

We are doing our best with COVID. 
Hope to be hosting you soon.

Building the house was my retirement dream, after a 27 year career in Special Education. I was proud to create a successful program to support  18 to 22 year old autistic and other neurodivergent students. This Adult Transition Program was the first in Orange County focused on integrating these students with their peers at Orange Coast College. My staff and I helped each student, with creative job development,  individually tailored to their strengths, interests, and talents, to find work that many sustained for decades. Prior to creating this Adult Transition Program, I was the director of a school for neglected and delinquent group-home teenagers in San Francisco. Carolyn and I were college sweethearts many, many years ago, at a small Quaker College  in Indiana (Earlham). We stayed friends through marriages, raising our families, and rediscovered our love for each other after losses. Carolyn is a Psychologist and Coach, with a private practice using the Enneagram as a tool to support individuals, couples, business leaders and creatives in their growth, and the integration of head, heart and hands, to become all that they can be.  Her first career was as a Spanish Bilingual teacher in San Francisco, while Bob was working with younger students in residential treatment at ClearWater Ranch in Anderson Valley, California. We've been so happy to discover that we each maintained interests in photography, travel, hiking, snorkeling, swimming in wild waters over all the years, and are thrilled to do so together in this reignited relationship. We also enjoy playing tennis, hiking the many trails here and in Marin County, and sharing each other's friends and family. We were both psychology majors in college, where we first worked with underserved populations. We have a photo history of coast to coast adventures from the past, and we're adding more, now.

My life therefore has been about relationships that matter. 
     I am a photographer.  I love travel and color and the combination of both is  ideal for me.  
     I love hosting couples, groups of women as well as their family members. I g love their complete immersion into the pleasure of our home and its' surrounding areas.  I love my reviews when people ""get it"" when it comes to our  beach home.  It's fun to hear they spent time trying to imagine the stories that went behind each segment  of decor.    I LOVE France, and then Italy, and Morocco.  Canada is up there too, because they speak French (even though I don't). 
    I also fancy myself a chef (colorful, tasteful, healthy food).   Don't forget to check out all the cookbooks and international magazines.   You will know that I love cooking when you see our custom designed kitchen, the myriad of cooking utensils, french door refrigerator, Viking Stove and Bosch Dishwasher.   The french doors off the dining area open out  to extend your eating areas and invite you for morning  a cup of coffee outside.   The french doors off the living room invite you to watch the fog roll away under the palm tree.  This is yet another thing I love. 
       Walt and I have been married for 35 years.  He is still in practice as a psychologist and has taught mindfulness meditation for about 30 years.  He is the quiet type but rarely sits still.
     Interior design with elegance, color, history and a sense of whimsy would well describe another of my passions.  I like changing things up from time to time so my return guests get to do it all over again.  I love exploring our area for new things for us to do as well as always keep it fun for our guests and their children.  As nice as the house is I encourage everyone to get out there and enjoy  the outside and outlying areas as well.  Nicene Marks is almost within walking distance   The beach is a short stroll.
        I like establishing a relationship with my guests before they arrive, so I know what they need and they know what I appreciate in a guest.  People ask me, ""how can you let strangers come in to this lovely home""?  Oddly, its not a problem.  To me our home is not a typical rental.  It is a shared lovely home and I think my guests understand that and feel honored to be there.  They want to maintain our relationship and so do I.
     You will get a feel for my passions as you sit on the couch in front of the fireplace, or on one of the many decks and peruse the books on design, photography, cooking and sweet novels that take place on or near the beach.

Welcome to my Aptos beach house. A little bit about me...

I spent 15 years living and working overseas with my family in Morocco, Lithuania, and Costa Rica. I returned to California in 2015 and fell in love with Aptos and the Monterey Bay for its beautiful beaches, mountains, and access to the San Francisco Bay Area. As a beach lover, surfer, runner, and hiker, I found Aptos to be the perfect spot to enjoy nature, the beach, and the mountains all with having quick access to San Francisco to see a Giant's baseball game or to head into Oakland or Berkeley for Ethiopian, Greek, or Indian food, to see a show, or hike in the hills. 

I love adventure travel and do most of my traveling with my kids so I understand what parents are looking for in a vacation - ease and simplicity, memory making, less time in the car and more time doing fun things together, etc.  I believe that showing children the world as often and as early as possible is important. 

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” - Mark Twain

I hope you enjoy my beach home and hope that you are able to explore, learn, enjoy life's simple pleasures, and make lasting memories there.

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a3b3f146-aae6-4013-8c78-c36f62adebee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a3b3f146-aae6-4013-8c78-c36f62adebee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,93,269,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Unincorporated Areas,,37.10791,-122.05714,Entire cabin,Entire home/apt,4,1,1 bath,2,2,"[""Heating"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Oven"", ""Iron"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Noise decibel monitors on property"", ""First aid kit"", ""Self check-in"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Private entrance"", ""Essentials"", ""Bathtub"", ""Kitchen"", ""Backyard"", ""Microwave"", ""Lockbox"", ""Coffee maker"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Stove"", ""Bed linens"", ""Baby safety gates"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Wifi"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Hot water"", ""Hangers""]",$137.00 ,2,1125,2,14,2,1125,4.2,184.1,,t,25,55,85,360,6/30/2024,104,13,1,8/12/2018,6/13/2024,4.56,4.72,4.61,4.73,4.62,4.65,4.4,,t,2,2,0,0,1.45

Our most priceless Airbnb memories are when we unplugged from our Silicon Valley life with our 2 kids and traveled around the world together for half a year, living and volunteering in Orphanages in rural villages in India, Thailand, Kenya, Uganda and Honduras. As we traveled between those countries, we stayed in Airbnb homes in between (Spain, Italy, Athens, Amsterdam, Iceland, and more).  We were warmly welcomed at every stay. 
We just became empty nesters with our kids away to college/Post-college, so we bought a home in one of our favorite places on earth -- Santa Cruz, where breathtaking Redwoods meet the shore in a charming beach community. We are so excited to live in Santa Cruz now and explore all its beautiful treasures, Learn the rich history, and enjoy this inclusive, thoughtful community.  

We were taken by this home when we saw the For Sale sign on an Anniversary sSanta Cruz visit. The owner Ted wanted to create a little tropical paradise and it was so clear that she had done so as an absolute labor of love. (You’ll see the hand carved doors from Bali and other authentic tropical touches). We moved into the home as soon as we could and we now spend alternate weekends caring for my aging mom in our former town, so when we are able, we love being able to provide magical, memorable Guest experiences for Guests, just as our Hosts have done for us around the world. <3",within a day,100%,67%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-421599560/original/06764c5e-1dba-442e-ab89-f8653be42d23.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-421599560/original/06764c5e-1dba-442e-ab89-f8653be42d23.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,3,"['email', 'phone']",t,f,Neighborhood highlights,City of Santa Cruz,,36.98851,-122.00886,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,1,1 bath,1,1,"[""Iron"", ""Rice maker"", ""Freezer"", ""Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, french press"", ""Gas stove"", ""Self check-in"", ""Toaster"", ""Radiant heating"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Private entrance"", ""Conditioner"", ""Stainless steel oven"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Shared beach access"", ""Keypad"", ""Essentials"", ""40 inch TV with Roku"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Free street parking"", ""Kitchen"", ""Body soap"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Shower gel"", ""Indoor fireplace: gas"", ""Blender"", ""Microwave"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Coffee"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Wifi"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Hot water"", ""Hangers""]",$175.00 ,30,1125,30,30,1125,1125,30,1125,,t,0,0,0,56,6/30/2024,11,4,0,9/13/2021,4/15/2024,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,f,1,1,0,0,0.32
